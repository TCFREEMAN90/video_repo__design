# Redesign Prompt

**Use with:** Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any AI coding assistant

**Purpose:** Apply the visual style from a mockup image to your actual application code

---

## The Prompt

```
Use the attached screenshot as visual inspiration to redesign this application.

Pull the visual style, layout, spacing, and component expressions from the image. Match the theme and design language you see.

Constraints:
- Preserve the application's structure, hierarchy, and functionality
- Focus on the UI and interactions—don't add or remove features
- Any imagery, illustrations, photos, or complex visual assets in the screenshot may be approximated, simplified, or ignored if source assets are unavailable

This is a re-theme, not a rebuild.
```

## How to Use

1. Get a themed mockup image (from the ideation step, Dribbble, or anywhere)
2. Paste/attach that image to your AI coder
3. Use this prompt
4. Let it restyle your app

---

## What It Does Well

- Pulls color schemes from the image
- Matches spacing and padding patterns
- Applies rounded corners, shadows, and visual weight
- Updates typography feel (though not always exact font matching)

## What It Won't Do

- Recreate complex illustrations or graphics
- Match fonts exactly (it approximates)
- Add features that weren't there

---

## Tips

- If you only want to redesign ONE part of your app, take a screenshot of just that area and include it with the prompt
- If it's not pulling enough from the image, be more specific: "Use the exact color palette from this image" or "Match the border radius and shadow style"
- If it's adding too much, add: "Keep it simple—no decorative elements"
- You may need to iterate. First pass gets you 70-80%, then push in on the details that matter to you
