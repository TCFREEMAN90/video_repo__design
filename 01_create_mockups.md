# Prompt 1: Create Mockups

**Use with:** ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI with image generation

**Purpose:** Generate themed mockup images from your app screenshot

---

## What This Does

You give it a screenshot of your app. It gives you back a redesigned mockup 
image with your chosen theme. This image becomes the reference for the next step.

---

## The Prompt

```
I've provided a screenshot of an existing application. Please redesign the UI as a
visual mock-up image (not a functional app) using a [THEME]-inspired theme that feels [ADJECTIVES].

The redesign should preserve the structure and usability of a real application—avoid
purely decorative effects or excessive gradients. Focus on re-theming and visual
expression while keeping it realistic and usable.
```

---

## How to Customize

Replace the bracketed sections:

| Placeholder | What to Put | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `[THEME]` | Your inspiration | flowers, space, ocean, bubbles, construction, forest, neon |
| `[ADJECTIVES]` | The feeling you want | open, creative, lightweight, colorful, calm, energetic, professional, playful |

## Tips

- **Too many graphics?** Tell it: "Less imagery, focus on the color and typography theme"
- **Want options?** Ask for 2-3 variations
- **Just one section?** Screenshot only that part of your app
- **Extract assets?** ChatGPT is good at generating transparent PNGs if you want to pull out elements later
