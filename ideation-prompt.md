# Ideation Prompt

**Use with:** ChatGPT, Gemini (with image generation), or any AI that can generate images

**Purpose:** Generate a themed mockup image of your app that you can then apply with your AI coder

---

## The Prompt

```
I've provided a screenshot of an existing application. Please redesign the UI as a visual mock-up.

Using a [THEME]-inspired theme that feels [ADJECTIVES].

The redesign should:
- Preserve the structure and integrity of the real application
- Avoid purely decorative effects or excessive gradients
- Focus on re-theming and visual expression
- Keep it realistic and usable
```

## How to Use

1. Take a screenshot of your app (or just the part you want to redesign)
2. Paste the screenshot into ChatGPT or Gemini
3. Replace `[THEME]` with your inspiration (flower, space, ocean, construction, bubbles, etc.)
4. Replace `[ADJECTIVES]` with the feeling you want (open, creative, lightweight, colorful, professional, calm, energetic, etc.)
5. Send it and see what comes back

## Tips

- If the result has too many graphics/illustrations, tell it: "Less imagery, focus on the color and typography theme"
- If you like the result but want variations, ask for 2-3 more options
- ChatGPT is particularly good at generating transparent PNG assets if you want to extract elements later
- Don't try to get it perfect—you're looking for a direction, not the final product
