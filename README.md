# AI Design Workflow - Prompts & Resources

These are the prompts from the video "AI Gave You Coding. Now It Gives You Design."

## The Workflow

1. **Ideation** - Use ChatGPT/Gemini to generate themed mockup images from your app screenshot
2. **Apply** - Bring that image into Claude Code (or your AI coder) to apply the visual style
3. **Lock It In** - Generate a design concept + design system so your app never drifts back to generic

## The Prompts

| File | What It Does | Use With |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `ideation-prompt.md` | Generates themed mockup images | ChatGPT, Gemini |
| `redesign-prompt.md` | Applies a visual style to your app | Claude Code, Cursor, etc. |
| `design-system-prompt.md` | Creates design concept + design system docs | Claude Code, Cursor, etc. |

## Quick Start

1. Take a screenshot of your app
2. Use the **ideation prompt** with ChatGPT to get a themed mockup
3. Copy that mockup image
4. Use the **redesign prompt** with your AI coder to apply the style
5. Once you like it, use the **design system prompt** to lock it in forever
