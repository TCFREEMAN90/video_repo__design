Prompts from the video **"AI Gave You Coding. Now It Gives You Design."**

## The Workflow

| Step | Prompt | Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| 1 | [Create Mockups](01_create_mockups.md) | ChatGPT, Gemini | Generate themed mockup images from your app screenshot |
| 2 | [Redesign from Mockup](02_redesign_from_mockup.md) | Claude Code, Cursor, etc. | Apply the visual style to your actual code |
| 3 | [Create Design System](03_create_design_system.md) | Claude Code, Cursor, etc. | Lock in your design with concept + system docs |

## Quick Start

1. **Take a screenshot** of your app (or the part you want to redesign)
2. **Prompt 1** → Paste into ChatGPT with the mockup prompt → Get a themed image
3. **Prompt 2** → Bring that image to your AI coder → Apply the style to your app
4. **Prompt 3** → Once you like it, generate the design system → Never drift back to generic
